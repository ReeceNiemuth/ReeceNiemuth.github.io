Welcome to my site! I’m Reece Niemuth, a cybersecurity professional working in the defense contracting world with a focus on **Systems Engineering, Automation, Cloud Security, Mission Assurance, and Secure Systems Design**.  

This site is where I publish what I learn — from **hands-on lab projects** in my home setup, to lessons from working on **Workplace Security Initiatives** and advanced security governance such as **NIST, ISO, NSA, DCSA, DISA, and more!**.

You’ll also find:
- 🎓 **Certification Training Materials**
- 🖥️ **Home Lab Project Updates**
- 📚 **Book and Resource Recommendations** 
- 🔗 **My Alternate External Profiles**

My goal is to make complex security processes easier to understand for myself and others, whether just starting out or you’re deep in the trenches of Commercial or Federal cybersecurity.  

Stay tuned — I’m continuously updating this site with new insights, walkthroughs, and resources to help you build both technical skill and professional impact.
