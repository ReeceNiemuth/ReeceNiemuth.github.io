  # About Section

    title: "About Me"
    image: "/images/profile.webp"
    content: |-
      I've been a computer nerd my whole life. Started tinkering with old tower PCs in my grandfather's garage, built gaming rigs with friends, got into robotics and electronics in high school. After serving in the Marine Corps as an engineer focused on electronics, I discovered cybersecurity through all the "cyber warfare" talk happening in the military. It clicked immediately: a field that combined my love for technology, protecting critical systems, and the constant hunt for better tools and solutions.

      Now I work as a **Technical Information System Security Officer (ISSO)** and hybrid cybersecurity professional, specializing in **DoD RMF, JSIG, NIST SP 800-53, and STIGs** across SAP and classified environments. I blend risk management and compliance with hands-on engineering, building automation, dashboards, and security tooling using Python, PowerShell, Bash, Splunk, Nessus, SCAP, and OpenSCAP. My goal is to translate dense security requirements into practical, code-driven solutions that actually make people's lives easier.

      What gets me out of bed is hearing someone say, *"This is great, this will save us so much time."* I love the relentless pace of this field, the endless stack of knowledge to master, and the challenge of staying ahead of the next big tool or threat. Right now, I'm pursuing my **Doctorate in Cybersecurity Analytics** while building passion projects in AI-assisted security tooling and federal compliance automation.

      When I'm not working, I'm in my homelab running the "Patriot Command Operations System (PCOS)" — a fully documented environment where I practice the entire system lifecycle per NIST and RMF without risking production systems.
